=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Tree;

    my $tree = new Text::Tree( "root",
                               [ "left\nnode" ],
			       [ "right", [ "1" ], [ "2" ] ] );
    print $tree->layout("boxed");

=head2 new()

    my $tree = new Text::Tree( "label",
                               [ "left child label", [ ... ] ],
			       [ "right child label", [ ... ] );

Create a new tree object from a nested set of array references.  The
first element of each array must be a string used as a node label.  The
remaining elements must each be an array reference for a child of the
node.  Labels may contain newlines to support multiple lines of text.

{
    my ($pack, $label, @subnodes) = @_;
    my @subobjects = map { $pack->new(@$_) } @subnodes;

}

=head2 layout()

    my @lines = $tree->layout( "centered in boxes" );
    print @lines;

Lays out the tree into an array of newline-terminated strings, ready for
printing or displaying.  The optional style argument may contain various
keywords such as 'center', 'box', 'line', 'oval' and/or 'space'.  These
style keywords affect how the tree nodes are formatted.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows the caller to develop a tree structure, using nested arrays of
strings and references.  Once developed, the whole tree can be printed as
a diagram, with the root of the tree at the top, and child nodes
formatted horizontally below them.

The string labels are printed as-is, or optionally surrounded with a
simple outlining style using printable ASCII characters.

This module may be used with object-oriented or simple function calls.

=head1 HISTORY

Mark Jason Dominus (aka MJD) asked for this functionality on his
Expert-level "Perl Quiz of the Week" Number 5.  You can find out more
about the QOTW discussion forum at http://perl.plover.com/qotw/

The central formatting routine was submitted by Ron Isaacson to the Quiz
forum as one possible solution to the general problem.

Ed Halley adapted the Ron Isaacson entry (with permission), to correct
some tree structures not originally handled, and to allow more formatting
options for the box styles.
